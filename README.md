### Flask Application Design

#### HTML Files

1. **index.html**: This is the main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the application. It should contain the necessary HTML and JavaScript code to allow users to interact with the game. It should include options for selecting the desired rating for the computer opponent and a chessboard where the game is played.

2. **game.html**: This HTML file is used to display the actual chess game. It will show the current state of the board, moves made by both players, and any analysis or feedback provided by the application.

3. **about.html**: This HTML file contains information about the application, such as its purpose, features, and how to use it. It may also include information about the developers or contributors to the project.

4. **help.html**: This HTML file provides instructions and guidance to users on how to use the application effectively. It may include explanations of the different settings and options available, as well as troubleshooting tips.

#### Routes

1. **Homepage**: The homepage route is associated with the **index.html** file. When a user accesses the application, this route is triggered, and the **index.html** file is served, presenting the main interface to the user.

2. **StartGame**: This route handles the initiation of a new game. It receives the desired rating for the computer opponent as a parameter and initializes the game accordingly. It then redirects the user to the **game.html** file to start playing.

3. **MakeMove**: This route processes user moves. It receives the move made by the user and updates the game state. It also generates the computer's response move and updates the game state based on that move. The updated game state is then sent back to the user.

4. **GetAnalysis**: This route provides analysis of the game. It receives the current game state and returns an analysis of the game, including suggestions for improving the user's play.

5. **About**: This route is associated with the **about.html** file. When a user clicks on the 'About' link, this route is triggered, and the **about.html** file is served, displaying information about the application.

6. **Help**: This route is associated with the **help.html** file. When a user clicks on the 'Help' link, this route is triggered, and the **help.html** file is served, providing guidance on how to use the application.
